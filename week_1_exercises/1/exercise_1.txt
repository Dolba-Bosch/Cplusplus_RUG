Description and summary

The first exercise is about writing a 'hello world' program in c++.

- To create the object file and executable respectively, the following 
commands were used:
g++ hello.cc -c --std=c++26 -Wall
g++ hello.o -o hello --std=c++26 -Wall -s

- A short description of the object file and executable:
When the compiler compiles the program, the C++ code gets compiled into 
machine code. The object file contains this machine code. This is not enough
however as the C++ code may contain dependencies like libraries. These
dependencies have been compiled earlier and to create the executable, the
compiler takes all the object files of the C++ script and dependencies and 
links them together in a single executable. 

-The compiled program when run gives the following output
Hello world

-The requested filesizes are obtained by running wc --bytes < file:
hello.cc    116
hello.o     6600
hello       14424
iostream    3074
