- Explain what redirection or piping is. In particular, explain what happens in
- program < in > out
- program | less

Piping is way to use the output of one program as the input of another program. 
In the first example, program > out, the output of program is redirected to the 
file out.
In the second example, program < in, the file in is used as the input for 
program.    
In the third example, program | less, the output of program is piped to the
program less. In other words the ouput of program gets used as the input of
less.
