Exercise 2
C++
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition?
A declaration introduces a name into the program and specifies which type it has
A definition gives a value to a name.

- What are header files used for?
Header files are a way to reuse code. A header file can contain a set of 
functions and variables that can then be included in other C++ files.
For example, the iostream header file contains the functionality of cout and cin
So instead of having to define cout and cin in every file, the iostream header 
file can be included in the file.

- In what part of the construction process does the compiler use header files 
and in what part libraries?
Header files contain source code that is included in the program.
Libraries contain precompiled object code that is linked to the program.
Hence header files are used during the compilation process and libraries are 
used during the linking process.

-Is a library an object module?
Yes, a library is precompiled object code which is equivalent to an object 
module. 

-  Why is an object file obtained after compiling a source containing 
int main() not an executable program? 
An object file is not an executable program as it contains code that references
functions and variables that are not defined in the object file but rather in
other object files or libraries. By linking the object file with other object
files and libraries, the references are resolved and an executable program 
can be created.
