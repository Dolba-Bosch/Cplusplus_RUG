Exercise 3

- Describe 6 new additions to C++ which are not available in C.
1. C++ has classes which are not available in C. Classes are a way to group
data and functions together. This makes it easier to work with data and
functions that are related to each other.
2. C++ has operator overloading (adding new functionality to operators) 
which is not available in C.
3. C++ has more possibilities for data hiding. Which can make data definitions
cleaner.
4. Functions in C++ can be defined inside a struct which makes it cleaner to
work with. In C the function would require a pointer to the struct to work.
5. C++ added references which is like an alias or synonym for a variable. This 
can make code cleaner and easier to read.
6. C++ added the scope resolution operator (::) which allows you to use
variables with the same name but with a different scope. This is not available
in C.
