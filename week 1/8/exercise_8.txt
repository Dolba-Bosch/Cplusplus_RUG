Working with command line arguments from the terminal.
The trick in this exercise is to make use of the ternary operator,
in order to switch between what would essentially be two string expression.

To call the program so that it displays the 1st argument use:
./program 1 arg2 arg3 arg4
This returns:
hello 1
