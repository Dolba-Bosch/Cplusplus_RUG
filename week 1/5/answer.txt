 Redirection is mainly about the stdin, stdout and stderr streams that any process has,
 by default. So let's consider the given example

                       program < in > out

 This should stream into the stdin of the `program` process, the contents of the file "in",
 while also streaming the process's output (whatever is printed to the terminal using
 std::cout) into the file "out".

 In the case of
                       program | less
 the output of program is piped to the program less. In other words the ouput of
 program gets used as the input of less.


 Piping on the other hand essentially links the stdout of a previous process with the
 stdin of the following process. The shell probably creates a temporary file behind the
 scenes, which is actually redirected to from the first process's stdout, and redirected
 from into the second process's stdin.
